# RL-CounterfactualRewriting
This repository leverages reinforcement learning to generate coherent story endings based on counterfactual scenarios. It features custom metrics (Δ𝑀1, Δ𝑀2) for targeted reward functions, fine-tunes a T5 model, and offers a streamlined codebase for efficient training and evaluation.
